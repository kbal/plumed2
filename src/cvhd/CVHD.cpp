//+PLUMEDOC FUNCTION CVHD
/*
Convert a (set of) CV(s) into the CV of the CVHD method.

In the simplest use case (one argument), the CV is calculated as follows for
values between 0 and CUTOFF:
\f[
C=\frac{1}{2} \left ( 1 - \cos left ( \pi \frac{x}{x_{cut}} \right ) \right )
\f]
Effectively, any CV is projected on an interval between 0 and 1.

If multiple arguments are supplied, these are first combined as follows, using
the power supplied through the POWER keyword.
\f[
x=\left ( \sum_{i} x_{i}^{p} \right )^{1/p}
\f]

The coefficients c, the parameters a and the powers p are provided as vectors.

Typically, this function is used with the BONDDISTORTION or GLOBALDISTORTION
CVs, as an argument for a metadynamics or VES bias in CVHD mode.

Notice that CVHD is not able to predict which will be periodic domain
of the computed value automatically. The user is thus forced to specify it
explicitly. Use PERIODIC=NO if the resulting variable is not periodic,
and PERIODIC=A,B where A and B are the two boundaries if the resulting variable
is periodic.
